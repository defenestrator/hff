                <p>and its legions of wannabe fly fishing legends, before $1,200 graphite rods, $700 reels,
                    $100 lines and $15 leaders, before $300 polarized fashion sunglasses, before cell phones, before blogs,
                    Go Pros, fly fishing videos, pro staffers and the fly fishing industry's official uniform of technical wear,
                    there was a man in blue jeans and a work shirt with a fiberglass fly rod discovering a new world
                    ...the new world of fly fishing the saltwater flats. </p>

                <p>One of fly fishing's living legends, Winston Moore.</p>
                <p> The Hobo Fly Fishing team was speechless as he shared his experiences of casting a fly in the new world.</p>
                <p>We aren't exaggerating, the title of his official biography is "Winston: The Legend!" </p>
                <p>We were fortunate enough to have a chat with him about his pioneering efforts flyfishing on the
                    saltwater flats, and elsewhere, starting in the late 1950's!
